# RT5-Client (branch 578)

This is a decompiled 578 client, originally built on Dec 16 2009.

No refactoring has been done and this is only enough to compile and run. No server is included.  
Usage: `.\gradlew.bat client:run --args='10 live english game0'`

## TODO

- Test HD mode, add natives
- Fix signlink, got named as Class259
